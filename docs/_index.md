{{< warning title="Nothing here applies to 1.x" >}}
All documentation for the current, produciton-ready version of the plugin is in the README.md in the project repository.
{{< /warning >}}

{{< warning title="This guide is still under construction" >}}
All of the documentation for 1.x versions of the plugin was in the readme. For 2.x, I want a more developed set of
documentation that gives people as much information as they need. I'm still writing here, so expect some rough edges.
